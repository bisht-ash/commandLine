Ashish :
Question 1.
    1. He has used date function for date and time with +'%d-%m-%y' for date and +'%r' for time.
    2. He has used environment variable for USER, HOME and PWD.

Question 2.
    1. Took input from the command line.
    2. He has used regular expression matching to check if user has entered a number or not.
    3. Then, he ran a loop till 10 and print the table of the given number.

Question 3.
    1. Took input form the user.
    2. He has used regular expression matching to check if user has entered a number or not.
    3. Then he is checking for every number from 1 to sqrt(input) if it is a factor of imput if the number of factor is greater than 2 he returns "not a prime".
    4. Else the number is prime.

Question 4.
    1. First he is checking if the directory already exists using ' -d "$(pwd)/Assignment/" '
    2. Then, he is creating a new file using touch.
    3. To copy the content of a file he has used '>' .
    4. To append "Welcome to Sigmoid" he is using '>>' .
    5. For listing the content looping over all the file in Desktop and printing them.

Question 5.
    1. Initialize a array.
    2. For length of array, he has used '${#arr[@]}'.
